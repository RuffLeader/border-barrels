  <p>Winter getaways have often been limited to a single weekend in Melbourne, or day trip to the Victorian High Country. Canberra has also crept in as of late as a great destination.</p>

  <p>I’m sure the mention of these locations will have your brain running wild about all the incredible breweries one can attend on the journey!</p>

  <p>For my family and I, heading further North hasn't been at the top of the priority list during the colder months, despite yours truly believing himself to be a bit of a sunchaser.</p>

  <p>So we set out to change that, by using the mid-year school holiday break to travel to the Gold Coast via some incredibly cool stop over towns.</p>

  <p>As a passionate craft beer consumer, balancing the needs of kids with my own interests can be a bit of a tricky task. Generally, before approaching my better half with a lunch, dinner or 'quick schooner' request, I run it through a set of rules.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Do they have a kids menu?</li>
    <li>Is there a play area, or games?</li>
    <li>Do they brew something other than beer my wife might enjoy?</li>
  </ol>

  <p>As you will learn from the following recount, despite all good intentions, those questions don't always end up being answered with an unequivocal yes, however we were certainly blessed to have nothing but positive experiences and fun stories to tell about our trip.</p>

  <h2>King Tide Brewing – Coffs Harbour</h2>

  <p>King Tide Brewing in Coffs Harbour immediately facilitated the development of those core family holiday memories, as we walked in the dark and followed our noses, courtesy of a double brew day taking place that afternoon and evening. The unmistakable aroma of a wort boil was our North star, blanketed upon arrival by the outrageously delicious wood fired pizzas from Tuesday guest kitchen 'Two-Five'.</p>

  <p>The spacious alfresco area included a play area, and an adjacent table was where we took up camp.</p>

    </div>

  </div>

  <p><strong>Highlights included:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Rite Of Passage</em> — immediately the most underrated core range Red IPA in Australia.</li>
    <li>A stunningly deep and funky barrel aged Saison — a must-have, even for those reluctant about the style.</li>
    <li><em>The Hideaway Hazy IPA</em> — a delight for hopheads, and resulted in a follow up schooner.</li>
    <li><em>Blues & Roots Ginger Beer with Blueberries</em> — sounds gimmicky, but excellent in execution.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The wife insisted on some takeaways to enjoy throughout the rest of our journey.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, a massive thank you to the passionate and knowledgeable staff, who assisted with limited release tidbits, as well as facilitating a quick hello to head brewer Josh as he smashed down dinner between brews. He was hard at work, while I was hard at drinking, but meetings with talented industry professionals are just as rewarding for yours truly as the eventual beers are themselves.</p>

  <h2>Sealegs Brewing – Brisbane</h2>

  <p>Brisbane's Sealegs Brewing boasted the most modern interior, with the venue sitting beneath the shade of the famous Story Bridge, creating a 'metropolistic' but highly memorable atmosphere when compared to other breweries on our trip.</p>

  <p>A pinball machine and large family games kept the kids entertained, while once again it was the classic brewery pizza proving to be a winner with all who ordered.</p>

  <p>Due to self-control concerns, I was unable to bring home any beers for a future showcase episode; however, Sealegs may be worth a revisit. Fun can art, big blurbs and a varied selection really lend themselves to our format.</p>

  <div class="photo-grid">
    <div class="grid-images">

    </div>
    <figcaption>Sealegs — Modern-Industrial Feel</figcaption>
  </div>

  <p>The Red IPA in particular was a standout, nailing every brief.</p>

  <p><em>True North Haze</em>, boasting insanely eye-catching artwork on the can, was also a refreshing take on the standard hazy IPA — slightly lower ABV at 5.8%, with a soft, pillowy mouthfeel, resulting in a beer that could be compared to the now-legendary Mountain Culture Status Quo, but raised on a diet of kangaroo steaks and protein shakes.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Time went far too quickly, and we had been informed that traffic heading south from Brisbane is permanently set to "make you want to kill someone", so we bid farewell to Sealegs — but hopefully just for now.</p>

  <h2>Bucket Brewery – Kempsey</h2>

  <p>A last minute decision to find a playground for the kids after a long travel day landed us in Kempsey.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the need for a drink and snack was far more enticing than a swing and a slide.</p>

  <p>In one of those heart-warming moments where you realise you made the correct decision in choosing your life partner, my wife said "isn't there a brewery here?" Google Maps set our course for Bucket Brewery, and off we went.</p>

  <div class="photo-grid">

      <img src="/media/photos/zach-northern-5.jpg" alt="Bucket Brewing Beer Garden">
    </div>
    <figcaption>Bucket Brewing Beer Garden</figcaption>
  </div>

  <p>Approaching the venue, you would be forgiven for thinking you're somewhere you're not meant to be, especially on a quiet, overcast Tuesday afternoon. A large, old industrial area in a country town — basically the complete antithesis of Sealegs.</p>

  <p>Thankfully, despite some initial concern, they were indeed open!</p>

  <p>The immediate attention grabber was the huge articulated bus in the beer garden. Imagine the delight of two young children seeing a massive purple bus covered in paintings of dragons, water and hops — then discovering the interior is decked out with books and games!</p>

    </div>

  </div>

  <p>Sharing that enthusiasm, I was excited to walk inside the brewery and see beer!</p>

  <p>Two beers were sampled, before the inevitable purchase of a takeaway 6 pack — the Mandarin NEIPA and the Bucket Black Lager.</p>

  <p>Both were quite standard, with a real DIY, earthy charm. In other words, nothing to ignite the fires of an Untappd rating, but absolutely perfect for what they were in the setting.</p>

  <p>Should we ever return, an entire afternoon sinking the full range next to a bus in the Kempsey sun is my idea of a near-perfect scenario.</p>

  <h2>Eden Brewery – Mittagong</h2>

  <p>With the sun firmly in our rear view mirror and home inching closer, a final stop over in Mittagong created one last opportunity for a holiday beer (or several). The biggest culture shock was travelling from warm, sunny Queensland to the ice-cold Southern Highlands of NSW on a 6-degree evening.</p>

  <p>To tick off parental duties, the kids went nuts in the local McDonald's playground while smashing down Happy Meals. Mum and Dad had Happy Meals in mind as well — courtesy of a beer paddle from Eden Brewery and a juicy feed from in-house food slingers Boozy Burgers.</p>

  <div class="photo-grid">
    <div class="grid-images">
      <img src="/media/photos/zach-northern-7.jpg" alt="Eden Brewing">
    </div>
    <figcaption>Eden Brewing</figcaption>
  </div>

  <p>Immediately the vibe was completely different from our Northern brewery visits. This felt homely. This was clearly the 'local' for plenty of Mittagong residents.</p>

  <p>I can’t pinpoint whether it was the warm lighting, the friendliest bar girl in Australia, the earthy and consistent quality of the beers, or simply the collective atmosphere — but I never wanted to leave.</p>

  <p><strong>Beers tried (and purchased to go):</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Willow XPA</li>
    <li>Ponderosa IPA</li>
    <li>Joshua Tree Lager</li>
    <li>Phoenix D Kottbusser — a style brewed only once before in Australia!</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A thick, crunchy southern fried chicken burger was the perfect accompaniment to my paddle — a fantastic exclamation point on a beer-blessed holiday.</p>

  </div>

  <p>If in Eden, also consider the Renegade Moonshine — varied liqueurs at 30%, with flavours like Shortbread, Key Lime Pie, American Apple Pie and more.</p>

  <p>Thank you to all the incredible independent breweries we visited on our winter holiday — for the beers, for the food, for being so accommodating to families, and most importantly for being absolute legends.</p>

  <p>I couldn't have stumbled upon a more uplifting passion all those years ago, and that doesn't even come close to matching the passion and talent of the people involved in the breweries themselves.</p>

  <p><strong>Cheers to great beers 🍻.</strong></p>
