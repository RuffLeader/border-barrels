A huge double dry hop of Cryo Nelson Sauvin from New Zealand provides gooseberries, passionfruit and lychee that is perfect for our warm festive season. Bright, crisp and dry body showcasing pure hop expression. Nelson Sauvin delivers gooseberry, passionfruit and lychee with hints of tropical fruit.

    blurb: "A super-clean malt profile carrying a shipload of juicy tropical fruit flavours including citrus, pineapple, mango, and a hint of papaya, all resting atop a crisp and lean malt base. Crafted from Pale, Carahell, and Carpils malts and hopped with Simcoe (US), Cascade (AUS), Mosaic (US), Citra Cryo (US), and Citra (US), it delivers a vibrant, refreshing, and perfectly balanced drinking experience. With an IBU of 35 and a Gold Medal win at the Australian International Beer Awards 2024, this brew stands tall as a true showcase of tropical brilliance and clean, modern craftsmanship.",

      sarah: "*Smacks-lips* It’s nice for me, someone who doesn’t particularly like beer, but it’s also weak, the flavours are kind of weak."
